# Social-Media-Site--Do-a-good-job-everyday--
This a personal Project of me where people can post the good job they have done everyday. People can also comment and get inspired
by his good job. People can also ask for a help and challenge other to do a good job. 

This project was challenging as i needed the page from refreshing every time someone posted a status or a comment. I used AJAX for being
able to do this. Doing this project i learned a lot. 

Although this project is not what i thought it would be. One of my friend gave me the idea to do this project and i could not implement 
every functionalty he asked me for. But doing this project i really learned a lot.
